      - title: Working with the Centroid
        text: The Geospatial Centroid offers technical services in spatial analysis, cartography, interactive web applications, and remote sensing. We also offer grant/proposal assistance for those seeking to add a spatial component to their research. While some Centroid services are free, there is a fee for tasks requiring more time or expertise. Centroid staff and interns have a wide range of interests and skills. For inquiries, please send an email to&#58; [gis@colostate.edu](mailto:gis@colostate.edu).
      - title: Technical Assistance
        text: For geospatial technical assistance, it is best to set up an appointment by sending an email to&#58; [gis_help@colostate.edu](mailto:gis_help@colostate.edu). You can also visit the Centroid at 211G Morgan Library (located on the north end of the second floor) during its hours of operation. (Spring 2024&#58; Mon-Thurs, 10&#58;00-4&#58;00)
      - title: Training Resources and Events
        text: The Centroid offers periodic training and workshops in standard GIS software applications (ArcGIS, QGIS), programming (R/Python), and other timely topics. In addition, we often sponsor geospatial-related presentations and guest speakers. Check out the Centroid Event Calendar for upcoming activities or sign up for the [GEOSPATIAL listserv](https://lists.colostate.edu/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/geospatial) to receive notifications of events and other opportunities
